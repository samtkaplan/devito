    "# Performance optimization overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial illustrates the performance optimizations applied to the code generated by an `Operator`. As we shall see, most optimizations are automatically applied as they're known to systematically improve performance. Others, whose impact varies across different `Operator`s, are instead to be enabled through specific options.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Operator has several preset **optimization levels**; the fundamental ones are `noop` and `advanced`. With `noop`, no performance optimizations are introduced by the compiler. With `advanced`, several flop-reducing and data locality _optimization passes_ are performed. Examples of flop-reducing optimization passes are common sub-expressions elimination and factorization; examples of data locality optimization passes are loop fusion and cache blocking. SIMD vectorization, via compiler auto-vectorization, is enforced through OpenMP pragmas.\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimization pass may provide knobs, or **options**, for fine-grained tuning. As explained in the next sections, some of these options are given at compile-time, others at run-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\*\\* Remark \\*\\***\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism -- both shared-memory (e.g., OpenMP) and distributed-memory (MPI) -- is _by default disabled_ and is _not_ controlled via the optimization level. In this tutorial we will also show how to enable OpenMP parallelism (you'll see it's trivial!). A mini-guide about parallelism in Devito and related aspects is also available [here](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/tree/master/benchmarks/user#a-step-back-configuring-your-machine-for-reliable-benchmarking). \n",
