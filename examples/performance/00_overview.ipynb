    "# Performance optimization overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial illustrates the performance optimizations applied to the code generated by an `Operator`. As we shall see, most optimizations are automatically applied as they're known to systematically improve performance. Others, whose impact varies across different `Operator`s, are instead to be enabled through specific options.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Operator has several preset **optimization levels**; the fundamental ones are `noop` and `advanced`. With `noop`, no performance optimizations are introduced by the compiler. With `advanced`, several flop-reducing and data locality _optimization passes_ are performed. Examples of flop-reducing optimization passes are common sub-expressions elimination and factorization; examples of data locality optimization passes are loop fusion and cache blocking. SIMD vectorization, via compiler auto-vectorization, is enforced through OpenMP pragmas.\n",

    "An optimization pass may provide knobs, or **options**, for fine-grained tuning. As explained in the next sections, some of these options are given at compile-time, others at run-time.\n",

    "At first glance, it's the same story as before, with a two-dimensional tensor temporary extracted and computed in a separate loop nest. By paying closer attention, however, we may note that there are now four occurrences of `r3` in the expression computing `u`, while before, in `op7_omp` for instance, we had only two. Devito seeks for a compromise between compilation speed and run-time performance, so it runs by default searching for redundancies across sum-of-products of `depth=5` or lower. `depth=5` sum-of-products are the typical by-product of second-order derivatives, which is what many PDEs have. There are other reasons behind the default value, which for brevity aren't discussed here. To search for deeper sum-of-products (and, therefore, for redundancies induced by higher order derivatives), one shall use the `cire-repeats-sops` option."
